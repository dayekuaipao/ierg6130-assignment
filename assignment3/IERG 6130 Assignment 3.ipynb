Some of them may be easy such as uncommenting a line, some of them may be difficult such as implementing a function. You can find them by searching the `[TODO]` symbol. However, we suggest you to go through the notebook step by step, which would give you a better understanding of the content.\n",

    "Unlike supervised learning, in RL setting the signal: reward and the output of neural network: the action distribution parameter (like the logits in discrete case or the mean in continous case) have no direct connection in terms of gradient. That is, you can't compute the gradient from the environment to your network output. \n",
    "\n",
    "To leverage the powerful tool of gradient descent, scientists innovated a technique called policy gradient, which is computed on top of the rewards and policy network's output. Scientists prove that: the policy gradient is the gradient of expected return w.r.t. the output. So that by applying gradient descent to gradient descent algorithm you can optimize your policy network and maximize the expected return (or minimize the negative of expected return).\n",

    "Concretely, if we consider the expected return, the value we want to maximize, is:\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason for this trick is that the probability of a trajectory is the product of all related probabilities of states and actions. So introducing a log term can change the production to summation: $p_\\theta(\\tau) = p(s_0, a_0, ...) = p(s_0) \\prod_t \\pi_\\theta (a_t|s_t) p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$ Now we can expand the log of product above to sum of log:\n",

    "## Section 3: Policy gradient with baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "(25 / 100 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the REINFORCE algorithm above. We compute the gradient of $Q = \\mathop{\\mathbb E} \\sum_t r(a_t, s_t)$ w.r.t. the parameter to update the policy. A natural question is that, when you take an inferior action that lead to positive expected return, the policy gradient is also positive and you will update your network toward this action. At the same time a potential better action is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this problem, we introduce \"baseline\" when computing the policy gradient. The insight behind this is that we want to optimize the policy toward an action that are better than the average performance when taking all action into consideration at a given state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce $b_{t} = \\mathbb E_{a_t} \\sum_{t'}{\\gamma^{t'-t} r(s_{t'}, a_{t'})}$ as the baseline. It average all possible actions at state $s_t$. So that the profit achieved by action $a_t$ can be evaluated via $\\sum_{t'=t} \\gamma^{t' -t}r(a_{t'}, s_{t'}) - b_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the policy gradient becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_\\theta Q =\\cfrac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N [( \\sum_t  \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t}) (\\sum_{t'} \\gamma^{t'-t} r(s_{i,{t’}}, a_{i,t‘}) - b_{i, t})]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation, we estimate the baseline via an extra network `self.baseline`, which has same structure of policy network but output only a scalar value. We use the output of this network to serve as the baseline, while this network is updated by fitting the true value of expected return of current state: $\\mathbb E_{a_t} \\sum_{t'}{\\gamma^{t'-t} r(s_{t'}, a_{t'})}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In implementation, we use a trick to match the distribution of baseline and values. During training, we first collect a batch of target values: $\\{t_i= \\mathbb E_{a_t} \\sum_{t'}{\\gamma^{t'-t} r(s_{t'}, a_{t'})}\\}_i$. Then we normalzie all targets to standard distribution with mean = 0 and std = 1. Then we ask the baseline network to fit such normalized targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "When computing the advantages, instead of using the output of baseline network as the baseline $b$, we firstly match the baseline distribution with action values. The transformed baselines $b' = f(b)$ should has the same means of action values and same STD of action values too. Then we compute the advantage of current action: $adv_{i,t} = \\sum_{t'} \\gamma^{t'-t} r(s_{i,{t'}}, a_{i,t'}) - b'_{i, t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, we mitigate the instability of training baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: We suggest to normalize an array via: `(x - x.mean()) / max(x.std(), 1e-6)`. The max term can avoid potential risk of error."
